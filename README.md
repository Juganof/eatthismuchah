AH Personal Meal Planner

Personal-use meal planner that builds daily menus from Dutch recipes (Allerhande and others) and local products (Albert Heijn). It stores data in a local SQLite DB and provides a simple CLI to ingest and plan meals.

Features
- Local SQLite database (no cloud) for personal use
- Ingest recipes from recipe URLs (parses JSON-LD from pages like Allerhande)
- Import Albert Heijn products from a JSON/CSV export you control
- Generate daily meal plans targeting calories and macros

Status
- Scrapers are designed for personal use and to be run by you. The Allerhande parser works from a recipe URL with JSON-LD. The AH product scraper is left as a stub because AH site/API may change and can require anti-bot work; for personal use, import products from your own JSON/CSV export.

Quick Start
1) Initialize the DB:
   python -m ah_mealplanner.cli init-db

2) Ingest your own data

   - Import AH products from your JSON/CSV export:
     python -m ah_mealplanner.cli import-products --file /path/to/your/products.json

   - Ingest a recipe from a URL (e.g., Allerhande):
     python -m ah_mealplanner.cli ingest-allerhande --url "https://www.ah.nl/allerhande/recept/..."

3) Generate a meal plan for a day
   python -m ah_mealplanner.cli plan-day --calories 2200 --meals 3 --exclude "noten,pinda" --date today

Data Model (simplified)
- products: AH products with nutrition per 100g/ml and metadata
- recipes: Recipes with per-serving nutrition and ingredients
- ingredients: Linked to recipes; can optionally map to products
- meal_plans + meal_plan_items: Saved plans by date

Notes on Scraping and Legality
- This code is for your personal use only. Respect website terms, robots.txt, and rate limits. Prefer exporting data youâ€™ve obtained legitimately (e.g., via your own browsing data or manual export) over automated scraping.

Full-Site Crawling (Personal Use)
- Discover + ingest many recipes via sitemaps:
  - python -m ah_mealplanner.cli crawl-allerhande --limit 500
  - Add specific sitemaps with --sitemap URL (repeatable)
- Discover + ingest many AH products via sitemaps:
  - python -m ah_mealplanner.cli crawl-ah-products --limit 500
  - Product parsing is best-effort (JSON-LD / Next.js data); adjust in `ingest_ah.py` if AH changes.

Customize Targets
- You can pass calories and meals per day via CLI. Macro targets default to 30% protein, 35% fat, 35% carbs but can be changed with flags.
